        <h2>What is Air Pollution?</h2>
        <p>Air pollution is the presence of harmful substances in the air, causing negative effects on human health and the environment. It can result from various factors such as industrial activities, vehicular emissions, and deforestation.
Air pollution is contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any chemical, physical or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere.

Household combustion devices, motor vehicles, industrial facilities and forest fires are common sources of air pollution. Pollutants of major public health concern include particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Outdoor and indoor air pollution cause respiratory and other diseases and are important sources of morbidity and mortality. </p>
        
        <h2>Why is it Dangerous?</h2>
        <p>Air pollution can lead to respiratory diseases, heart problems, and other health issues. It can also damage ecosystems and contribute to climate change.
Exposure to air pollution can affect everyone’s health. When we breathe in air pollutants, they can enter our bloodstream and contribute to coughing or itchy eyes and cause or worsen many breathing and lung diseases, leading to hospitalizations, cancer, or even premature death.

Minnesota’s air currently meets all federal air quality standards. However, even levels of air pollution below the standards can affect people’s health, including levels currently found in parts of Minnesota.

No matter where you live, you can be exposed to air pollution from vehicle exhaust, smoke, road dust, industrial emissions, pollen, gas-fueled yard equipment, chemicals we use in our homes, and other sources.

Both short-term and long-term exposure to air pollutants can cause a variety of health problems. For people with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD/emphysema or chronic bronchitis), air pollution can make it harder to breathe, trigger asthma attacks, or cause wheezing and coughing. Air pollution also increases the risk of respiratory infections, heart disease, stroke, and lung cancer, and more severely affects people who are already ill.

People’s health risks from air pollution vary widely depending on age, location, underlying health, and other factors. Many studies show that low-income communities and minority populations are disproportionately exposed to air pollution and are more vulnerable to adverse health impacts. Data from the Minnesota Department of Health show disparities in heart and lung disease by age, race/ethnicity, income level, and geography. Minnesota also has significant disparities in asthma prevalence by race/ethnicity. The asthma hospitalization rate among Twin Cities children is more than 50% higher than among children living in Greater Minnesota.</p>

        <h2>What Can You Do?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduce car usage – walk, bike, or use public transport</li>

            <li>Plant trees and maintain green spaces</li>
            <li>Reduce waste and recycle materials</li>
<li> Drive in an eco-friendly way that saves fuel and reduces harmful emissions.</li>
<li>Use filters for chimneys.</li>
